Interested in helping out? We'd love for you to contribute to DataLad and make
it even better!

DataLad is written in Python and is open source (released under the MIT license);
all development happens on `GitHub <https://github.com/datalad/datalad>`_.

A good entry point is our `Easy Hacks <https://github.com/datalad/datalad/labels/easy>`_,
a list of good starter tasks we maintain for newcomers to familiarize themselves
with our code and development process. You should also make sure to read the
`contributing document <https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
to make sure you follow DataLad's coding style and conventions.

We've written a post about `benchmarking git-annex across file-systems <test_fs_analysis.html>`_,
and also maintain a `benchmarking dashboard <http://datalad.github.io/datalad/>`_
that tracks the performance of various DataLad operations.

The documentation is found in the source tree in the `docs subfolder
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/tree/master/docs>`_.

If you would like to help with the website or have suggestions, you can find the
code and issue tracker at http://github.com/datalad/datalad.org.

Want to get in contact with us? `Twitter <https://twitter.com/datalad>`_ and
`our matrix chatroom <https://matrix.to/#/#datalad:matrix.org>`_ are best, but
we also have a team email account at `team@datalad.org
<mailto:team@datalad.org>`_.
