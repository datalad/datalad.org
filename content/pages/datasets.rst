DataLad can track any data files that are published on the web. It is able
to monitor and incorporate modifications made to such data sources over time,
and to publish entire distributions of datasets created by this automated
process. The DataLad team maintains data trackers for a number of public data
portals. The generated datasets are available at http://datasets.datalad.org\.

At present, this website offers uniform access to over 10TB of scientific
data. This includes datasets from

- `OpenFMRI <https://openfmri.org>`_
