Why DataLad?

When publishing data, merely providing file access is insufficient for a simple
reason: data are not static. Released data often (and should!) continue to
evolve; file formats can change, bugs will be fixed, new data are added, and
derived data needs to be integrated.

While version control systems are a de-facto standard for open source software
development, a similar level of tooling and culture is not present in the open
data community.

DataLad builds on top of `git-annex`_ and extends it with an intuitive
command-line interface. It enables users to operate on data using familiar
concepts, such as files and directories, while transparently managing data
access and authorization with underlying hosting providers.

A powerful and complete Python API is also provided to enable authors of
data-centric applications to bring versioning and the fearless acquisition of
data into continuous integration workflows.
