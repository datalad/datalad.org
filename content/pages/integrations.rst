DataLad is used as an infrastructure component or utility in a growing number of
services and software packages.

- Since June 2018, `OpenNeuro <https://openneuro.org>`__ offers a `service
  <https://github.com/openneuroorg/datalad-service>`__ to access all datasets on
  the platform as `DataLad datasets via GitHub
  <https://github.com/openneurodatasets>`__.

- DataLad is a supported data provider on the `CBRAIN platform <http://cbrain.mcgill.ca>`__
  at the `McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience <http://mcin.ca>`__.

- The DICOM conversion tool `HeuDiConv <https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv>`_ uses
  DataLad to organize and version control its output datasets.

- The `CBBS imaging platform <http://imaging-docs.cbbs.eu/datamanagement>`__
  builds on DataLad to manage data capture, management, and analysis workflows
  for neuroimaging research.

- There is an ongoing collaboration with the `brainlife.io <https://brainlife.io>`__
  platform to create a unique marketplace that aids discoverability and re-use of
  publicly available datasets.
