Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. The only thing worse
than yellow snow is green snow. These things happen automatically. All you have
to do is just let them happen. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a
mountain.

Let's get crazy. Here we're limited by the time we have. Do an almighty painting
with us.

I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue. We
have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. We need dark
in order to show light.

They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put
even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. You don't have to be crazy to do this
but it does help. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.

Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every
limb is perfect. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun
wouldn't forget them. You gotta think like a tree. I'm sort of a softy, I
couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. It looks so good, I might as well not
stop. This painting comes right out of your heart.

Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Don't
kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. And that's when it
becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening
- you just let it happen. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little
path.
