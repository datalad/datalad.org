Data are key to many applications, and while an enormous amount of data is
available, it is all-too-often impossible for interested parties to consume the
relevant pieces efficiently, become aware when any part of it changes,
and why it changed.

For a growing number of data portals, the DataLad team provides `native
DataLad datasets </datasets.html>`__ that offer fine-grained access to current
and historic version of many datasets.

However, the vast majority of all available data are scattered around the web
using an incomprehensible variety of sites, access methods, and formats. In
order to help mitigate this complexity, DataLad provides tools to
monitor non-DataLad data sources on the web. With these tools, DataLad users
are able to track their changes over time, curate them, and even re-publish
them as native DataLad datasets.

The following demo shows how one can create a readily usable dataset from data
and code posted on a textbook's companion website.
