DataLad is built atop of Git and git-annex, and if you are familiar with these
tools, you should feel at home with DataLad too. DataLad aims to be a unifying
top-level layer that makes working with Git and git-annex easier â€” without
getting in the way of power-users.

DataLad's most unique feature, compared to Git and git-annex, is its ability to
seamlessly work with an entire tree of nested repositories (i.e. Git submodules).
This is best explained in a brief demo:

.. raw:: html

    <asciinema-player src="/asciicast/seamless_nested_repos.json" cols="80" rows="24" poster="npt:104"></asciinema-player>
    <div class='dl-cast-script'><a href="/asciicast/seamless_nested_repos.sh">Get the script for this demo</a></div>

The following table helps to illustrate which features are contributed by which
technology layer.
