With the growing quantities and variety of data, it is getting progressively
harder to determine whether and where given data are available. DataLad
aids data discovery through a built-in, extensible system for automated metadata
extraction and homogenization.

Being a tool for decentralized data management, DataLad does not require a
central service to perform metadata queries. Instead, any DataLad installation
provides all the necessary functionality to automatically index and search any
data it was made aware of — whether it's one's personal data, the data of an
entire lab, all the data of an institution, or a complete public data portal.

The following demo shows how one can quickly find desired datasets,
install them, and selectively obtain necessary files across multiple datasets.
