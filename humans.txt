Thanks for taking the time to check out who we are; it's nice to be humanized.

You stay classy.

Apple Bread for Classy Humanizers
#################################

Makes: 2 loafs
Prep Time: 20 minutes
Bake Time: 40-45 minutes

Ingredients
-----------
115 g butter
2 eggs
200 g sugar
140 g 550 flour
150 g whole wheat flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. baking powder
120 ml milk
1 tsp. grated orange peel
1 tbsp. corn syrup [1]
125 g apple, grated
125 g walnuts

Directions
----------
Preheat the oven to 175 C. Grease the loaf pans with butter.

In a large bowl, cream together butter, eggs, and sugar.

In a small bowl, mix together the remaining dry ingredients. Then, add the dry
mixture to the wet mixture alternatively with milk. Mix in the shredded apple,
orange peel, and corn syrup. Finally, fold in the walnuts.

Pour the batter into the loaf pans, and bake for 40-45 minutes â€” or until a
toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

[1] Honey is also an ok substitute. The key here is the invert sugar, which
    helps retain moisture and gives the top a nice, crisp texture.
