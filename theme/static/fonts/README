A quick rundown of the process to update Fontello icons:

* "import" the config.json on fontello.com
* Select needed icons. If external, drag-drop svg font onto the page
* Download and extract into css/ and font/
* Cleanup the CSS file a bit (spacing, and commented CSS rules)
* Cleanup the config.json, as it will include the full SVG path for each and
  every glyph in any imported SVG fonts you provided.
* Update copyright.rst if needed
