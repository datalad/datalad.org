      <h2 class="icon-flashlight">Discover Data</h2>
      <p>DataLad has built-in support for <strong>metadata</strong> extraction
      and <strong>search</strong>. With only a few steps, you can search through
      a large collection of readily available datasets and immediately download
      them. <a href="/for/dataseekers.html">See more...</a></p>

    <div class='card'>
      <h2 class="icon-download">Consume Data</h2>
      <p>DataLad offers direct <strong>access to individual files</strong>
      &mdash; great when you only need a few files from some large datasets for
      a web-demo or an analysis. Files in a dataset can be distributed across
      multiple download sources with tailored permissions to match your
      <strong>data privacy</strong> needs.

      <h2 class="icon-signal">Publish Data</h2>
      <p>DataLad supports sharing datasets with the <strong>public or just some
      colleagues</strong> on platforms that you are using already &mdash;
      <strong>no need for a central service</strong>. You have complete freedom
      to share your work in multiple platforms simultaneously (your own server,
      DropBox, GitHub, etc.) without losing track.

    <div class='card'>
      <h2 class="icon-cw">Reproducibility</h2>
      <p>DataLad provides <strong>joint management of analysis code <em>and</em> data</strong>.
      This enables you to comprehensively track the exact state of any analysis inputs that
      produced your results &mdash; across the entire lifetime of a project, and across
      multiple datasets.

      <h2 class="icon-sitemap">Data Portal</h2>
      <p>The DataLad project also operates a crawler that regularly indexes
         datasets from scientific data portals such as
         <a href="http://openfmri.org">OpenFMRI</a> and
         <a href="http://crcns.org">CRCNS</a>, making them trivial to acquire
         and work with using DataLad.
